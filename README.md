# Hello, if you're here, then you're probably looking to hire me. Here's what you need to know.

# Skills
I am skilled at backend web development using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)/[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as evident in https://github.com/vineet192/restaurant-emenu-backend, [Go](https://go.dev/) as evident in https://github.com/vineet192/dev-diaries, and Python([Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)) as evident in [my capstone project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wWuwWfDwkM).
I have a good understanding of RESTful APIs and the best practices associated with building them.

On the Frontend side, my go to framework is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as evident in https://github.com/vineet192/Restaurant-Emenu. What I love about it is the combination of the flexibility and DRY principles of React with the simplicity of server side rendering and routing.

In addition to the above stacks, I have a good working knowledge of building standalone applications in C, C++, Java and Python. Python being my favourite among the 4.
